#Workflow

1. Open cmder

2. find your project folder using cmder
`cd` to navigate directories
`cd/Desktop` takes you to the Desktop
`cd/connors-projects` takes you to your projects

3. Confirm you're in the right spot and pull new stuff
`git pull`

4. Make sure you've installed Visual Studio 2017

5. Open Visual Studio, Open Project, select HelloWorld project (might say Solution). The only file you need to worry about is
`connors-projects/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/main.c`

6. Make it work. Press F5 to compile and run.

7. Once it works, hit save and close.

8. Back in cmder do...
`git add *`
`git commit -m "complete HelloWorld"`
`git push origin master`

9. Fin. If you run in to any trouble, google it.
